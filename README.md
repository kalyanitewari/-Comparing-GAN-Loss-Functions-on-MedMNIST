# -Comparing-GAN-Loss-Functions-on-MedMNIST
This project evaluates the performance of LSGAN, WGAN, and WGAN-GP on the MedMNIST v2 dataset. It includes a unified GAN architecture, visual output comparison, and quantitative analysis using FID and Inception Score. Implemented in PyTorch for reproducible benchmarking in biomedical image synthesis.
